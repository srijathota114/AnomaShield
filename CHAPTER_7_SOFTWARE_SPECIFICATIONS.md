# Chapter 7  
# SOFTWARE SPECIFICATIONS

This chapter describes the main software technologies used in AnomaShield and explains why each one was chosen for the project. The front end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; the back end is built with Python and Django.

## 7.1 HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**HTML**  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to define the structure of every page in the application. It specifies the headings, paragraphs, forms, tables, buttons, and links that the user sees. In this project, HTML is not written as raw files alone; it is generated using Django templates. Each template is an HTML file with placeholders and simple logic (e.g. loops and conditionals) so that the server can fill in dynamic content (e.g. username, list of uploads, detection results) before sending the page to the browser. For example, the home page template contains the upload form and the area where recent uploads might be listed; the results page template contains the placeholders for summary cards, charts, and the tables of flagged and clean rows. HTML is used because it is the standard way to describe web page structure. Every browser understands HTML, so the application can run on any device with a web browser without installing extra software. Without HTML, there would be no structured page for the user to interact with.

**CSS**  
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control how the page looks: colours, fonts, spacing, layout, and the appearance of components like buttons and cards. In AnomaShield, CSS is used in two ways. First, Bootstrap 5 is loaded from a CDN. Bootstrap is a CSS (and JavaScript) framework that provides a ready-made grid system, navigation bar, forms, buttons, cards, and alerts. Using Bootstrap means that the layout is responsive (it adapts to different screen sizes) and that the interface looks consistent and professional without writing all the styles from scratch. Second, a custom CSS file (`style.css`) is used to add or override styles where the project needs something specific. So CSS is used to make the application readable, easy to use, and suitable for both desktop and smaller screens. Without CSS, the pages would be plain and hard to navigate.

**JavaScript**  
JavaScript runs in the user’s browser and handles behaviour that does not require a full page reload. In this project, JavaScript is used for several tasks. It initialises Bootstrap components such as tooltips and popovers so that help text appears when the user hovers over certain elements. It can check the selected file before upload (e.g. file type and size) and show an alert if the file is not allowed, reducing unnecessary server requests. It controls the toggle between Basic and Advanced view on the results page so that the user can show or hide extra details. Chart.js, which is a JavaScript library, is used to draw the bar chart and pie chart on the results page; the chart data is sent from the server (e.g. in the HTML or in a script tag), and JavaScript passes it to Chart.js to render the graphs. So JavaScript is used to make the interface interactive and to display the visualisations. Without JavaScript, the charts would not be drawn and some of the interactive behaviour would be missing, though the core flow (upload, view results, download) would still work because the main logic is on the server.

**Why these three together**  
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the standard technologies for building web front ends. They are supported by all major browsers, so the project does not depend on a specific browser or plugin. They also separate concerns: HTML for structure, CSS for appearance, and JavaScript for behaviour. This makes it easier to change the layout or styling without touching the logic, and to adjust the logic (e.g. chart rendering) without rewriting the whole page. For a final year project, using these three keeps the front end simple, portable, and understandable.

## 7.2 Python and Django

**Python**  
Python is the programming language used for the entire server-side part of the project. The detection engine, the views, the models, and the configuration logic are all written in Python. Python was chosen for several reasons. First, it has strong support for data processing and machine learning. Libraries such as pandas (for reading CSV/Excel and manipulating tabular data), NumPy (for numerical operations), scikit-learn (for Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM), and SciPy (for Z-Score and statistics) are widely used and well documented. Integrating these into the project was straightforward. Second, Python is easy to read and write, which helps when developing and maintaining the code. Third, Python runs on all major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS), so the project can be developed and deployed on a typical college or personal laptop. Fourth, the Django framework is written in Python, so using Python for the back end keeps the whole stack in one language. Without Python (or a language with similar libraries), implementing the detection algorithms and data pipeline would have been more difficult.

**Django**  
Django is a web framework for Python. It provides the structure and the building blocks needed to build a web application quickly. In AnomaShield, Django is used for the following. (1) **URL routing:** Each URL (e.g. `/`, `/login/`, `/results/5/`) is mapped to a view function, so the correct code runs for each page request. (2) **Request handling:** Views receive the HTTP request (including form data and uploaded files), run the business logic, and return an HTTP response (usually an HTML page or a file download). (3) **User authentication:** Django has built-in models and functions for user registration, login, and logout. The project uses these so that only logged-in users can upload files and see results, without implementing password hashing and session management from scratch. (4) **Database access (ORM):** Django’s ORM lets the developer define models (e.g. CSVUpload, DetectionResult) in Python; Django creates the database tables and provides an easy API to create, read, update, and delete records. This avoids writing raw SQL and keeps the code portable across different databases (e.g. SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production). (5) **Forms:** Django’s form classes handle validation and error messages for the upload form and the settings form. (6) **Templates:** Django’s template engine is used to render HTML pages with dynamic data passed from the views. (7) **Admin site:** Django provides an optional admin interface where a superuser can manage data (e.g. view or delete uploads) if the models are registered. So Django is used because it handles the common tasks of a web application (routing, auth, database, forms, templates) in one place, so that the developer can focus on the specific logic of the project (file upload, detection engine, results presentation) instead of rewriting boilerplate code. Without Django, the project would need another way to handle URLs, sessions, database access, and HTML generation, which would take more time and could be less secure if done manually.

**Why Python and Django together**  
Python provides the language and the data-science libraries; Django provides the web application framework. Together they allow a single team (or a single student) to build both the detection logic and the web interface in one codebase, using one language. The project can be run with a single command (`python manage.py runserver`) during development and can be deployed on a server running Python and a WSGI server such as Gunicorn. This choice is common in academic and small-scale projects because it balances simplicity, functionality, and the availability of libraries for both web development and machine learning.
